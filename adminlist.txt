--To find out someone's userid, start the game and click the "Account" button on the bottom left corner
--of the home screen. Look for the "KLEI USER ID" section. Copy the code that looks like something like
--this: KU_KozvIklj
--Then all you have to do is paste it anywhere below this message and it must be the only text on that line.
--(without the -- before it). DO NOT put any spaces or empty rows/lines before or after the userid(s). Put
--them immediately under this line.
